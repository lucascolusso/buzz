            How does a PhD student focus on doing good work without worrying about the number of papers churned out? Can we assess work in terms of the broader contributions of research and not just the impact factor of journals and conferences they are publish in? The answers to these questions is obvious, but while changes are not made, we offer you strategies to alleviate the terrifying social comparisons that permeate competitive academic environment.
          </p>

          <h3>Avoid extreme comparisons!</h3>
          <p>
            Avoid socializing and sitting next to other students in your lab
            who work 24/7 and are able to write a "best paper" in 1 day.
            And even if you can do that, is that actually the life you want?
          </p>

          <p>
            Second, use that browser extension to block Facebook during your
            work hours to avoid accessing Google Scholar all of the time.
            Do you know all of those studies saying that accessing Facebook every
            day makes people miserable? Accessing Google Scholar every day to check
            other scholars’ publication numbers makes you twice as miserable #facts.
          </p>

          <h3>Compare to those who are closer to you!</h3>
          <p>
            If you are a masochist and still desire to access Google Scholar
            all of the time to check others’ publication numbers, only compare yourself to
            other people who started their academic careers at the same time as you did.
            However, ideally, you should compare to those who started a few years
            later to make up for those 2 or 3 years of grad school when publications
            were slow due to awful R2 comments, dysfunctional advising relationships,
            and adapting to an engineering-oriented department coming from your
            background in Media arts/psychology/anthropology/communications/ (pick one).
          </p>

          <p>
            In interdisciplinary departments, social comparisons can be harmful and it is important to pick appropriate
            comparison targets (people with similar methods and contribution types, people with similar career goals, people with similar priorities for work-life balance). #micdrop
