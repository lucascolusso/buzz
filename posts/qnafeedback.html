          <p class="lead">Millions of students look to Brainly.com, a “Social Q&A” website, to ask questions and answer questions about homework. Students can search a database of millions of questions, or post their own question, which will be answered in minutes. Once they’ve received an answer, they can click a ‘thanks’ button, rate the answer from one to five stars, or leave a comment. Sounds like a helpful learning tool, right? Not always!</p>

          <p>Kids are posting their homework questions online verbatim, and too often, answerers -- the people answering the questions -- will post only the final answer to the question without any explanation. We know from decades of classroom study that this kind of “help,” while fulfilling the short term need of getting an answer, isn’t really helpful at all! Effective help comes with the right amount of explanation and can be used to answer other problems. Therefore, we tried giving crowd-sourced, criteria-based feedback to the answerers of 273 questions on Brainly.com. The results are not what we expected.</p>

          <p>We expected users to be gracious in their reception of the feedback. After all, over 40% of answers are completely ignored, so any feedback should be better than nothing. But the responses we got to our feedback ranged from disagreement to confusion to outrage.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="mb-0">You should be aware of what you are rating. But I think most [crowdworkers] are not . . . [A one-star rating] doesn’t mean the asker doesn’t get the idea, or didn’t get what he’s looking for.</p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer">Participant 4
              <cite title="Source Title"></cite>
            </footer>
          </blockquote>

          <p>One participant said, “I put the answer, step-by-step. The final result is correct, and I don't agree with the three and a half stars.” Clearly, this answerer desires feedback that is validating. And that reflects the current usage of star ratings on Brainly, where over 90% of ratings are five stars out of five. Another participant stated, “If it's correct, they would just five-star and give a ‘thanks.’ Which tells me that I substantially helped them.” So certainly they didn’t like less-than-five-star ratings in general, but there were other reasons to reject the feedback too.</p>

          <p>Answerers care about helping askers, and they don’t care for third-party, criteria-based opinions. “You should be aware of what you are rating. But I think most [crowdworkers] are not . . . [A one-star rating] doesn’t mean the asker doesn’t get the idea, or didn’t get what he’s looking for.” This gets at a critical dilemma for answerers: should answers be written to the asker’s standard, or to a higher objective standard?</p>

          <p>As outsiders, we are aware that these answers will be archived and potentially viewed by users long after the asker and answerer have left the site. But answerers may not be aware of this at all. One participant asked us, “If I type an answer, is that just a one-to-one conversation with the people asking the question, or are other students looking at, reviewing all those answers to learn something? I have no clue if that's happening. So, does Brainly become, like, a Wikipedia of questions already answered, or is it just something that only happens in the here-and-now?” Website designers need to make it clear that everybody benefits when answerers are elaborate and explanatory in their answers.</p>
