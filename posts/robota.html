          <p class="lead">Reporting activites at work is a common practice, either through stand-up meetings, emails, written reports or other means. Unfortunately, most employees consider it difficult, bordersome and borderline useless. Reporting progress is, however, very important for coordination and planning. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Could a conversational agent  offer a more engaging way of reporting?</li> 
            <li>Can the reporting be made more personally relevant through added personal reflection?</li> 
            <li>What is the impact of conversational modality on user experience?</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Existing tools support management centered reporting:</strong> Slack chatbots become increasingly popular for activity reporting at work, but mainly offer management-centered reporting that does support employees’ self-learning.</p>

          <p><strong>Modalities of conversation important for behavior change:</strong> Text and voice-based conversational agents stand to play an important role in supporting behavior change, wellbeing and productivity in various domains.</p>

          <h2>Robota Multimodal Conversational Agent</h2>
          
          <p>We designed and implemented a custom conversational agent called <strong>Robota (which stands for “work” in Polish)</strong> to support workplace journaling and reflection. Workers interact with Robota through chat and voice, and can explore past interactions through a web dashboard.</p>
          
          <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/rk2_overview.png" alt="overview of the Robota multimodal conversational agent. Users interact with Robota on Slack and als using Amazon Dash Wand for voice. They can access their reports and reflections using a web dashboard.">

          <p><strong>Chat module:</strong> We implemented Robota’s chat module as a “Slack bot” via the Slack API. The bot has the ability to send and respond to direct messages on Slack (a Slack bot appears just like a person on Slack, appearing in the user’s contact list).</p>


          <p><strong>Voice module:</strong> We used the Alexa Dash Wand – a handheld cloud-connected device with a built-in speaker and microphone that allows the user to take it to a quiet room and speak to it discreetly. The Dash Wand supports the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) and custom-built apps (called “Skills”). We implemented a custom skill that asks the user a random reflection question and listens to the user’s response.</p>

          <!--<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/rk2_robota_system_diagram.jpg" alt="Robota system diagram." style="width: 40%; height:40%; align: center">-->

          <h2>Robota in a Multinational Office</h2>

          <p>To understand the potential role of modality (chat vs. voice) for journaling and reflection with a conversational agent in the context of the workplace, we conducted a three-week in-situ deployment of Robota with 10 participants in our lab, which is part of a larger multinational corporation (English, Japanese, Chinese and French accents). We collected user feedback through survey and interviews.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/rk2_study.png" alt="Study diagram, three 1 week stages, first just journaling, then two weeks with voice or hat in randmized order">

          <h2>What did we learn?</h2>
          <p>Robota sent a total of 174 reminders for journaling. Robota also sent 98 requests for reflection followed by 59 reminders (34 in the Chat-Reflection condition and 25 in the Voice-Reflection condition). The average length of a daily activity log was 292 characters (SD=239.62). The average length of a response to reflection questions using chat modality was 131 characters, compared to 98 using voice modality.</p>

          <h4><img src="../img/rk2_reflection.png" style="width:35px; height:30px; display: inline; margin-right:5px;"/>Work Reflection with Robota</h4>
          <p>
            We found that reflection with Robota helps with <strong>management, organization and performance</strong>, it also encourages <strong>changing perspective and considering new aspects of work</strong>. Finally it promotes <strong>considering higher-level goals</strong> and the <strong>"bigger picture"</strong> related to ones activities and professional career.

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Easier to read questions, think about response:</strong>
              <blockquote>“It was easier to read the question and think about it”, “Reading is much faster than listening.”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Easier to reply in own time and describe details:</strong>
              <blockquote>“It's easier to answer than explaining in a voice. Since my English is not so good, I couldn't answer to a question immediately if I have to speak.”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Typing is time consuming:</strong>
              <blockquote>“Sometimes the answers to the questions are a bit complex, but I write something that is simpler and reductive because I don't want to spend time detailing it out on slack.”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Easier to review and change responses:</strong>
              <blockquote>“I also could more easily change my response with the chatbot before submitting.”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Slack seen as less personal:</strong>
              <blockquote>“Typing on slack is slightly more formal I guess, it is something that goes into the record”</blockquote>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Separate channel for reflection valuable:</strong>
              <blockquote>“It's good to have another means to quickly capture some useful points or thoughts.”</blockquote>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Easier to answer questions with voice:</strong>
              <blockquote>“It doesn't take much time to answer, is easier than writing report on Slack.”</blockquote>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Perceived pressure to respond immediately:</strong>
              <blockquote>“While using voice, it seemed to encourage me to answer right away, which is a bit stressful”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Listening to own responses inconvenient and uncomfortable:</strong>
              <blockquote>“It is not transcribed and listening to what I said many times is somehow troublesome.”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interactive, fun and engaging:</strong>
              <blockquote>“It was kind of neat to use the wand and have the voice reveal to me what the mystery reflection question was.”</blockquote>
            </li>
          </ul>
